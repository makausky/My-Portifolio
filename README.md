# Project description
The idea of this project is to develop an online, live and dinamic dashboard 
using data from Bovespa (with the python-yahoo API).
Using also a live forecasting (with ARIMA), the dashboard would provide a 
24h live view of the future trend-line of whatever asset from the brazilian
stock exchange you would like to see.
