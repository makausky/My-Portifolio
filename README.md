# My-Portifolio
The repo contains some samples of my Data Analysis skills.

# Project description
The goal of this project is to display some of the processes and methodologies I use when analyzing a data set.
In this portifolio I am working exclusevly with the Python programming language, in the format of Jupyter notebooks. I'm also using as guidance some of the best reference books, such as: 'Practical Time Series Analysis', by Aileen Nielsen; 'Python for Data Analysis', by Wes Mckinney; 'StoryTelling with Data', by Cole Nussbaumer.

# Here you'll find techniques of:
  
  - Data scraping/gathering;
  - Data cleaning;
  - Exploratory analysis;
  - Predictive analysis;
  - Error measurement;
  - Data display;
  - Storytelling.

This portifolio is in constant development, but soon you'll be able to see some presentation for the conclusions and results on each different project.

Thank you for passing by! :D
