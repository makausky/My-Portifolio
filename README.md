# My-Portifolio
The repo contains a sample of my Data Analysis skills.

# Project description
The goal of this project is to display some of the processes and methodologies I use when analyzing a data set.
In this portifolio I am working exclusevly with the Python programming language, in the format of Jupyter notebooks. I'm also using as guidance some of the steps displayed in the book 'Practical Time Series Analysis', by Aileen Nielsen.

# Here you'll find techniques of:
  
  - Data scraping/gathering;
  - Data cleaning;
  - Exploratory analysis;
  - Predictive analysis;
  - Error measurement.

For conclusions and results presentation, you can check the Marp file available in the "Conclusions" root.

Thank you for passing by! :D
