# Project description
The idea of this project is to develop an online real-time dashboard 
with data from Bovespa (Brazil's main stock exchange) using 'pandas_datareader'.
Featuring also a live ARIMA forecasting, the dashboard would provide a 
24h live display of a projected future trend-line of whatever asset from the 
brazilian stock exchange you would like to see.
